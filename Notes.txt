Styling:
Stripped Bootstrap: a bit heavy, and wanted to be more lightweight
Implemented own font choices


Implementation:

D3 Zoom functionality
	- Zoom would cause the image to jump to origin once zoom function was initiated
	  by the user. Had to make sure that zoomed image was translated the same as the
	  start image had been

Parsed kml file to create JSON file.
	- Removed (manually) location data for my home and for my friend's home 
	- Combined data from both friend's google data and my own to create a better
	  data collection from road trip


Added an about modal to talk about what the project is and my background
	- Using CSS modals -- not the bootstrap ones




TO DO:

Scroll to Draw

Color-code days for static plot
